        <h2>Biografia</h2>
        <p class="content">My name is Yosti Alexis Alejo Condori, I am a former chess player, I have been playing for 7 years, it could be said that since I was 11 years old I passed my first class, I did not think that I would go so far these 7 years that I was, I must say that I did not like it, nor did I know anything about chess, but my mother put me in that class so that I would be calmer and it did work.
        I would say that in these years I have made many achievements that I have been proposing to myself over time, I was the best under 16 and under 18 at the departmental level, those were my first achievements apart from participating in the plurals until the second phase, that has passed a year if I remember correctly, where another challenge came to me, that was to beat the best in all of Bolivia against GM Osvaldo Ronald Zambrana Enríquez.
        It was there when I wanted to be like him, to be the best player in Bolivia, but that's how the years went by where I didn't win the nations, until I came out national runner-up in Tarija, I qualified for the South American but as it was the first time it was bad for me.
        With that came the pandemic, with this I can say that I continued to dedicate myself to chess virtually, in which I continued to participate in tournaments, so much so that I returned to South America. came out of the top 10.
        For a moment in my life I thought I would leave school with nothing, but there was a last tournament in which I came out first and I left school happy, but I never thought that this would be the last one until now.
        This year 2022 I will be 18 years old, my last attempt to win the South American, but I could not win, my level is low for the competitive level, now I only teach at my school replacing my teacher who supports me so much, I am glad to know that at least if I am someone for the world since my history is there and I thank both my parents and my teacher for the support they gave me, with this I realized something.
        When I propose I do it.
